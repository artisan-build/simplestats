# How to track custom properties

Custom properties let you attach your own attributes to users and visitors so you can **group your analytics** by them. A property can be any dimension that matters to your business, for example:

- `company` — the organisation a user belongs to, so you can see which accounts drive the most registrations and revenue.
- `ab_test` — the variant a visitor was shown, to compare conversion rate and revenue between `A` and `B`.
- `account_type`, `industry`, `signup_source`, ... — really anything you can put a label on.

This is your own data, so the names and values are entirely up to you. _SimpleStats_ just breaks your metrics down by whatever you send.

::: info
Custom property tracking requires **version 4.1+** of the _SimpleStats_ [client package](https://github.com/simplestats-io/laravel-client).
:::

Each property is a **name** (the grouping dimension, e.g. `ab_test`) with a **value** (e.g. `B`), and your metrics (visitors, registrations, conversion rate, revenue) are broken down by these values.

::: info
A property keeps exactly **one current value** per entity. Re-tracking a user with a new value overwrites the old one, so revenue and activity always follow the latest value (e.g. a user re-assigned from variant `A` to `B` counts under `B`, including their past revenue). If you need to keep the history apart, report a dedicated value instead of reusing an old one.

## Tracking user properties

Register a **resolver class** in `config/simplestats-client.php`:

```php
'custom_properties_resolvers' => [
    'user' => App\Analytics\UserCustomPropertiesResolver::class,
],
```

The class implements the `ResolvesUserCustomProperties` contract and is invoked with the user model you already track. It returns the current properties as a `name => value` map. They are sent automatically whenever the user is tracked, no extra call needed.

```php
namespace App\Analytics;

use SimpleStatsIo\LaravelClient\Contracts\ResolvesUserCustomProperties;
use SimpleStatsIo\LaravelClient\Contracts\TrackablePerson;

class UserCustomPropertiesResolver implements ResolvesUserCustomProperties
{
    public function resolve(TrackablePerson $user): array
    {
        return [
            'ab_test' => $user->experiment_variant, // e.g. "A" or "B"
            'company' => $user->company_name,
        ];
    }
}
```

The resolver runs on every track, so it is also the place to **derive** values, not just read them off a column.

**Value rules and limits:**

- Values should be **scalar** (string, number, or boolean). Non-scalar or empty values are ignored.
- Names and values are trimmed to **252 characters**.
- A single track request may include up to **50 properties**.

## Tracking visitor properties

For properties that should be attached to a visitor right away, e.g. an A/B test variant assigned on the landing page, register a **resolver class** the same way:

```php
'custom_properties_resolvers' => [
    'visitor' => App\Analytics\VisitorCustomPropertiesResolver::class,
],
```

The class implements the `ResolvesVisitorCustomProperties` contract and is invoked at the moment a new visitor is tracked. The resolved properties are sent along with the visitor track itself:

```php
namespace App\Analytics;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Arr;
use SimpleStatsIo\LaravelClient\Contracts\ResolvesVisitorCustomProperties;

class VisitorCustomPropertiesResolver implements ResolvesVisitorCustomProperties
{
    public function resolve(Request $request): array
    {
        // assign the variant on the spot and keep it for the rest of the visit
        $variant = $request->session()->remember('ab_variant', fn () => Arr::random(['A', 'B']));

        return ['ab_test' => $variant];
    }
}
```

## Tracking properties manually

Use `trackCustomProperties()` to set properties on demand, anywhere in your application:

```php
use SimpleStatsIo\LaravelClient\Facades\SimplestatsClient;
use SimpleStatsIo\LaravelClient\Visitor;

// for the current visitor (e.g. an A/B test variant known before sign-up)
SimplestatsClient::trackCustomProperties(
    properties: ['ab_test' => 'B'],
    person: new Visitor(SimplestatsClient::getVisitorHash()),
);

// for a logged-in user
SimplestatsClient::trackCustomProperties(
    properties: ['ab_test' => 'B'],
    person: auth()->user(),
);
```

The user or visitor must already be tracked, for visitors this happens automatically on their first page view. Properties for a visitor that was never tracked (e.g. a bot, a blocked IP, or an excluded route) are skipped.

## Inheritance on sign-up

Properties tracked for a visitor are **inherited by the user registration** of the same visit: when the visitor signs up, their current properties (e.g. the A/B test variant) are sent along with the user track automatically. This way registrations, conversion rate, and revenue can be grouped by properties that were assigned before sign-up. Properties from the user resolver win on name conflicts.
