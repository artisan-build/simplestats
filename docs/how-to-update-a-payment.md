# How to update an already tracked payment

::: tip
Before continue, make sure to get familiar with the [How to track new payment](how-to-track-a-new-payment.md) documentation!

There are several scenarios in which updating a previously tracked payment might be necessary. Below are a few examples:

For this guide, lets assume your model which holds your payment data is called `Transaction`.

## Listen for Changes

Consider a scenario where a `Transaction` has been marked as "completed" and successfully tracked. If now for any reason, the `total` of the transaction changes subsequently, it is essential to update this information in _SimpleStats_ to maintain accurate records. For this you can listen for any changes made to your `Transaction` model by listing the fields in the `watchedTrackingFields` method.

To update the `gross` and `net` on our site, when your model's `total` changes, the implementation might look as follows:

```php
use SimpleStatsIo\LaravelClient\Contracts\TrackablePaymentWithCondition;

class Transaction extends Model implements TrackablePaymentWithCondition
{
    //..
    
    /**
     * The gross amount of the payment in cents ($1 = 100 Cent).
     */
    public function getTrackingGross(): float
    {
        return $this->total;
    }

    /**
     * The net amount of the payment in cents ($1 = 100 Cent).
     */
    public function getTrackingNet(): float
    {
        return $this->total - $this->tax;
    }
    
    /**
     * The condition that should be fulfilled in order to track the payment.
     */
    public function passTrackingCondition(): bool
    {
        return $this->status === 'completed';
    }

    /**
     * The field(s) we should listen for changes to recheck the condition.
     */
    public function watchedTrackingFields(): array
    {
        return ['status', 'total'];
    }
    //..
}
```

Congrats, now if the `total` of the `Transaction` changes and the `status` is "completed", the payment will be updated on our side.

## Handling Refunds and Chargebacks  

The same concept can be used to handle refunds and chargebacks.
Let's assume you set a `refuned_at` timestamp on your `Transactions` model when a refund happens.

Now you may want the `gross` and `net` for this payment to be "0":

```php
use SimpleStatsIo\LaravelClient\Contracts\TrackablePaymentWithCondition;

class Transaction extends Model implements TrackablePaymentWithCondition
{
    // ...
    
    /**
     * The gross amount of the payment in cents ($1 = 100 Cent).
     */
    public function getTrackingGross(): float
    {
        if ($this->refunded_at !== null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        return $this->total;
    }

    /**
     * The net amount of the payment in cents ($1 = 100 Cent).
     */
    public function getTrackingNet(): float
    {
        if ($this->refunded_at !== null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        return $this->total - $this->tax;
    }
    
    /**
     * The condition that should be fulfilled in order to track the payment.
     */
    public function passTrackingCondition(): bool
    {
        return $this->status === 'completed' || $this->refunded_at !== null;
    }

    /**
     * The field(s) we should listen for changes to recheck the condition.
     */
    public function watchedTrackingFields(): array
    {
        return ['status', 'total', 'refunded_at'];
    }
    // ...
}
```

This mechanism provides extensive control over the actions triggered by changes in certain states within your model. Utilize this flexibility to implement the required logic according to **your specific needs** — the implementation details are entirely at your discretion!
