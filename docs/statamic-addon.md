# Statamic Addon

The SimpleStats Statamic addon adds a full analytics dashboard directly inside your Statamic Control Panel. Instead of switching between your site and the SimpleStats dashboard, you get visitor trends, revenue charts, conversion rates, and traffic sources right where you already work.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2+
- Statamic 6+
- A SimpleStats API token

::: tip
The addon uses the same `SIMPLESTATS_API_TOKEN` as the Laravel client package. If you already have the client installed, you don't need a second token.
:::

## Installation

Install the addon via Composer:

```bash
composer require simplestats-io/statamic-addon
```

Add your API token to your `.env` file:

```env
SIMPLESTATS_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
```

That's it. A new **SimpleStats** entry appears under the **Tools** section of the Control Panel navigation. Open it to see your dashboard.

## Configuration

All configuration is optional. The addon works out of the box with just an API token.

### Publishing the Config File

If you want to override the defaults, publish the config:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="simplestats-config"
```

This creates `config/simplestats.php`:

```php
return [
    'api_url' => env('SIMPLESTATS_API_URL', 'https://simplestats.io/api/v1'),
    'api_token' => env('SIMPLESTATS_API_TOKEN'),
    'cache_ttl' => 60,
];
```

All values can be set via environment variables.

## Widgets

The dashboard includes seven pre-built widgets:

### Stats Overview

Six KPI cards at the top of the dashboard:

- **Visitors** and **Registrations** with trend indicators
- **CR** (Conversion Rate) from visitor to registration
- **Net Revenue** in your team's default currency
- **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User)
- **ARPV** (Average Revenue Per Visitor)

Each card shows the percentage change compared to the previous period when a comparison is active.

### Charts

- **Visitors & Registrations Chart:** Line chart showing both metrics over time, with optional comparison period overlay
- **Revenue Chart:** Gross and net revenue trends over the selected time range

### Top Lists

- **Top Sources:** Traffic sources ranked by visitor count (utm_source)
- **Top Countries:** Geographic distribution of visitors
- **Top Referrers:** Referring domains that send visitors to your site
- **Entry Pages:** Landing pages where visitors arrive first

## Time Range Filter

The dashboard includes a time range dropdown with the following presets:

- Today / Yesterday
- Last 7 Days / Last 30 Days
- Last 12 Weeks / Last 6 Months
- This Month / Last Month
- This Year / Last Year
- All Time

The default is **Last 7 Days**. All widgets update automatically when you change the filter.

## Caching

API responses are cached to keep the dashboard fast and reduce API calls. Multiple widgets sharing the same filters reuse a single cached response.

- Default TTL: 60 seconds
- Set `cache_ttl` to `0` to disable caching
- Uses your application's default cache driver

```php
// config/simplestats.php

'cache_ttl' => 300, // 5 minutes
```

## Self-Hosted

If you're running a self-hosted SimpleStats instance, point the addon to your own API via `.env`:

```env
SIMPLESTATS_API_URL=https://stats.yourdomain.com/api/v1
SIMPLESTATS_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here
```

## Error Handling

The addon handles API failures gracefully. If the API is unreachable or the token is invalid, widgets display empty states instead of throwing errors. Connection issues are logged as warnings for debugging.
