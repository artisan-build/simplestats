# How to track a new visitor

Once you have installed the _SimpleStats_ [client package](installation.md#composer),
visitor tracking is set up **automatically** —
no additional configuration is required on your part.
We ensure
this process is **GDPR**-compliant by generating a unique `visitor_hash` if a new visitor visits your site.

## The Visitor Hash

The hash is created from a combination of the visitor's `User-Agent`, the `IP address` and a `daily salt`.
This allows us to track unique visitors without storing any personally identifiable information,
keeping their data **safe** and **private**.

The `visitor_hash` enables seamless visitor identification across different sessions and provides insights into how your **marketing campaigns** and UTM parameters drive traffic.

With this, you gain a clear picture of which marketing efforts contribute most **effectively** to your site's growth, all while respecting _user privacy_.

::: tip
This privacy-first hashing approach is similar to what other analytics tools like **Plausible** and **Fathom Analytics** use. The key difference is that SimpleStats tracks entirely server-side, making it invisible to ad blockers. See [Counting Visitors](/counting-visitors) for how this affects your numbers versus other tools.
