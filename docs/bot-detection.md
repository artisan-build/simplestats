# Bot Detection

_SimpleStats_ filters out **bot and crawler traffic** automatically on the client side, so your visitor counts reflect real humans, not scrapers or uptime monitors. Bot detection is enabled by default and requires no configuration.

A request is **skipped** (no visitor recorded, no API call dispatched) when:

- the User-Agent matches a **known bot signature** via [matomo/device-detector](https://github.com/matomo-org/device-detector), covering thousands of crawlers, scrapers, AI/LLM crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, etc.), social media previewers, and uptime monitors
- the User-Agent is **not a real browser or mobile app**: HTTP libraries (curl, python-requests, ...), headless browsers, and scripted clients faking a browser User-Agent
- the request is a speculative browser **prefetch/prerender**, since the visitor may never actually see the page
